              <li>Sometimes when you suggest it to people doing UX work you get a lot of pushback</li>                            
              <li>Like "I'm already swamped" "This is going to take way longer" "Why do I have to do this? It's their job" 
              "This is going to stifle my creativity"</li>
              <li>There are some legitimate reasons why it won't work for everyone but I wanted to share my experience for people

              <li>They told me they liked me, but in this role they wanted someone who could really build prototypes with Bootstrap</li>
              <li>They had a small team I'd have would work closely with the engineers in a collaborative way to build the UI</li>
              <li>I was nervous about it, but I really liked the company and wanted the job, so I just said I'm gonna go for it</li>

            <ul>
              <li>I've been designing in Fireworks since the splash screen looked like this, 1998</li>
              <li>And that worked pretty well for me. I knew that thing like the back of my hand.</li>
              <li>I'd studied all the features, I'd run FW trainings for my teams. I could debate the pros and 
              cons vs Photoshop</li>
              <li>It worked for me because for the most part I worked in a kind of traditional waterfall environment</li>              
              <li>I wrote long, detailed requirements documents and produced static mockups that went along with them</li>
              <li>No point in learning to produce my own code because the developers probably wouldn't use it anyway</li>              
              <li>I'd spent some time with HTML CSS books and played around a bit, so I understood conceptually, but far from expert</li>
              <li>By contrast, in Fireworks I could make anything I could imagine. But there's a downside to that - there's really no
              actual connection between what I'm drawing and what's feasible or desirable technically - so I have to go refer to those
              external constraints rather than working and living within them.

          <h2>Frameworks can help</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Frameworks make this much easier because you don't have to start from scratch. You get something that pretty much
              works out of the box. Then you can take it from there.</li>
              <li>You'll want to customize it to fit your brand, to develop the specific widgets that you'll need for your particular
              project</li>
              <li>But it's great because it drastically reduces the startup cost of design within the browser, and makes the learning 
              curve a lot more manageable for people who haven't done it before.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Once we got our workflow set up, and I figured out what I was doing, I realized it was pretty fast</li>
              <li>Especially if I was making something that was similar to what we had before, or just changing something</li>
              <li>I realized that I could still produce enough mockups to keep our entire Dev team busy</li>
              <li>Usually, UX is not the bottleneck. Dev is the bottleneck because good devs are hard to find, and what they 
              do just takes longer, it's the nature of the work.</li>
              <li>So from a business perspective, it makes a lot of sense for me to take on as much of that front-end work as 
              possible because they can spend their valuable time on more difficult programming work</li>
              <li>It also leads to better design results because I can specify much more than I can in even an extremely 
              detailed requirements document, because I'm working in the natural medium</li>
              <li>Obvious one, how should the page adapt to different resolutions/screen sizes</li>
              <li>How should the text elements wrap, how should they be justified, how should I handle if they get really long?</li>
              <li>What's in the dropdown menus and other interactive controls</li>
              <li>What's the tab order?</li>
              <li>All this stuff is easier to do by writing a few lines of code than creating different layers in Photoshop and 
              switching them on and off or making different pages and states in Fireworks and putting in those slice behaviors 
              if you want to show how something changes or writing a page of requirements that might get misinterpreted.</li>            
              <li>All those features are delivered naturally as part of a prototype, and the fact that they are delivered whether
              you want them or not is a good thing because it forces you to think about all those little details that can sometimes
              be too easy to gloss over if you're just creating images. That leads to a higher quality product.</li>  
            </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Consistency</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Speaking of high quality, one great benefit of this process is how easy it is to create consistency across your 
              design</li>
              <li>I've spent a lot of time making style guides, pattern libraries, symbol libraries, themes - all that stuff sucks.</li>
              <li>It sucks. It takes a ton of time to create. Getting people to read it, much less follow it is like pulling teeth.</li>
              <li>Because it's an extra step for them. You have to stop and go consult this other resource that tells you what 
              you're allowed to do. People don't like that. And it's very easy to ignore them if no one's checking.</li>
              <li>They also inevitably those things feel outdated a month after you've created them</li>
              <li>Your stylesheets are so much better because they're always current, always relevant</li>
              <li>You have to go out of your way if you want to deviate from them. And if you do deviate, you'd better be able to explain
              why you did because everyone's going to see it when you do a code review, which we'll talk about in a minute.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>It's hard at first</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>You'll be slow at first, there's some ramp up time</li>
              <li>You'll be tempted to go back to those old tools when you face difficulty. (Fireworks Bootstrap template)</li>
              <li>You'll question yourself and maybe even your self-worth, but it will be worth it.</li>
              <li>You'll adapt.</li>
              <li>I gotta tell you, once you get the hang of this, it's so much fun. You just get lost in that feeling of flow 
              when you're working on stuff and time just flies by.</li>
              <li>When you get it to start working for you, you feel like a kid playing with legos and it's just so awesome.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Is there still a place for those tools?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Is there still a place for those tools? Will I still get to use all those keyboard shortcuts I memorized?</li>
              <li>Yes, but early in the process</li>
              <li>I don't get too detailed. Once I get to a point where I'm pretty certain of the direction, it's easier to switch to 
              code so I don't end up duplicating work you'll have to do there anyway</li>
              <li>Obviously if I'm creating graphics or working with photos I still need to use them but often a paper and pencil 
              are good enough for those early stages</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>You'll need the support of your developers, you guys are in this together. You'll hit roadblocks that only they 
              can fix</li>
              <li>Work with them to choose a framework. We chose Bootstrap but there are others out there. Foundation is one.</li>
              <li>Fork the framework on GitHub with your team</li>
              <li>You'll need a hosted version of it that everyone shares where you can create any documentation you want, 
              put your prototypes up</li>
              <li>Some kind of local server like thin or jekyll on your local machine that you can use to hack on a local version 
              until you're ready to sync your changes with your team</li>
              <li>A builder like rake that automatically compiles your CSS code so you can just change it and refresh your browser 
              to see the changes</li>
              <li>A way to do code reviews with your team. This is painful at first but it helps you. It's like learning the proper 
              form when you're exercising</li>
              <li>A process for merging in new versions of the framework when they come out so you can take advantage of new 
              features without losing your customizations</li>
            </ul>
