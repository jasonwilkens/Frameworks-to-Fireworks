          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>So, designing within the browser, by that I mean using HTML/CSS to produce prototypes of web designs rather
              than images created in something like Adobe Fireworks or Photoshop</li>
              <li>This is the snob trend lifecycle, has to do with twitter topics</li>
              <li>grew out of responsive design, for the screen size benefit</li>
              <li>For a lot of people, like me a year ago, it can sound daunting</li>              
              <li>Sometimes when you suggest it to people doing UX work you get a lot of pushback</li>                            
              <li>Like "I'm already swamped" "This is going to take way longer" "Why do I have to do this? It's their job" 
              "This is going to stifle my creativity"</li>
              <li>There are some legitimate reasons why it won't work for everyone but I wanted to share my experience for people 
              who are thinking about making that jump</li>
              <li>So how did I get here?</li>

          <h2>O.G.</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>I've been designing in Fireworks since the splash screen looked like this, 1998</li>
              <li>I was very sad when they announced they were stopping development on it</li>
              <li>And that worked pretty well for me. I knew that thing like the back of my hand.</li>
              <li>I'd studied all the features, I'd run FW trainings for my teams. I could debate the pros and 
              cons vs Photoshop</li>
              <li>It worked for me because for the most part I worked in a kind of traditional waterfall environment</li>              
              <li>I wrote long, detailed requirements documents and produced static mockups that went along with them</li>
              <li>No point in learning to produce my own code because the developers probably wouldn't use it anyway</li>              
              <li>I'd spent some time with HTML CSS books and played around a bit, so I understood conceptually, but far from expert</li>
              <li>By contrast, in Fireworks I could make anything I could imagine. But there's a downside to that - there's really no
              actual connection between what I'm drawing and what's feasible or desirable technically - so I have to go refer to those
              external constraints rather than working and living within them.</li>
              <li>So then I interviewed for a UX position at a really cool company called Bizo</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Bizonians</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>They wanted to start using Bootstrap to build their Saas platform UI</li>
              <li>These are Bizonians on shorts day. That guy in the blue vest on the left is our head of Engineering, Donnie</li>
              <li>They told me they liked me, but in this role they wanted someone who could really build prototypes with Bootstrap</li>
              <li>They had a small team I'd have would work closely with the engineers in a collaborative way to build the UI</li>
              <li>I was nervous about it, but I really liked the company and wanted the job, so I just said I'm gonna go for it</li>
              <li>In the past it was harder for companies like Bizo to set up a process like this because the 
              infrastructure that you need to make it work was a huge investment</li>

          <h2>frameworks can help</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Frameworks made this much easier because you don't have to start from scratch. You get something that pretty much
              works out of the box. Then you can take it from there.</li>
              <li>Stuff like a grid system, different validation styles shown here, form styles, all that stuff</li>
              <li>Then you can develop the specific widgets that you'll need for your particular project, and customize the look of 
              it to fit your organizations brand and visual identity</li>
              <li>So frameworks drastically reduce the startup cost of a design within the browser process, and as a side benefit
              they makes the learning curve of this process a lot more manageable for people like me who haven't really done it 
              before.</li>
              <li>So, what are some of the benefits I've found from working in this process? The first one is efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>team productivity</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>This is a sketch of a Kanban queue from the Kanban development process.</li>
              <li>Once we got our workflow set up, and I figured out what I was doing, I realized it was pretty fast</li>
              <li>Especially if I was making something that was similar to what we had before, or just changing something</li>
              <li>I realized that I could still produce enough prototypes to keep our entire Dev team busy</li>
              <li>Usually, UX is not the bottleneck. Dev is the bottleneck because good devs are hard to find, and what they 
              do just takes longer, it's the nature of the work.</li>
              <li>So from a business perspective, it makes a lot of sense for me to take on as much of that front-end work as 
              possible because they can spend their valuable time on more difficult programming work</li>
              <li>In terms of efficiency, I've found that this process lends itself to a lot more natural communication of 
              requirements with developers than you'll ever get from a written document alone</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>prototypes > mockups</h2>              
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>That's because I can specify much more in a prototype than I can in even an extremely 
              detailed requirements document, because I can include them in my code</li>
              <li>Obvious one, how should the page adapt to different resolutions/screen sizes</li>
              <li>How should the text elements wrap, how should they be justified, how should I handle if they get really long?</li>
              <li>What's in the dropdown menus and other interactive controls</li>
              <li>What's the tab order?</li>
              <li>Here's an example of a prototype I wrote for an advertising campaign report</li>
              <li>All these controls are easier to do show by writing a few lines of code than creating different layers in Photoshop and 
              switching them on and off or making different pages and states in Fireworks and putting in those slice behaviors 
              if you want to show how something changes or writing a page of requirements that might get misinterpreted.</li>            
              <li>All those features are delivered naturally as part of a prototype, and the fact that they are delivered whether
              you want them or not is a good thing because it forces you to think about all those little details that can sometimes
              be too easy to gloss over if you're just creating images.</li>
              <li>That leads to a higher quality product.</li>  
              <li>Speaking of high quality, that brings me to another benefit of this type of process.</li>
              <li>One of the best ways to improve usability in our products is to be consistent...              
            </ul>

          <h2>consistency</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>...much like McDonald's beef patties</li>
              <li>I've spent a lot of time making style guides, pattern libraries, symbol libraries, themes - all that stuff sucks.</li>
              <li>It sucks. It takes a ton of time to create. Getting people to read it, much less follow it is like pulling teeth.</li>
              <li>Because it's an extra step for them. You have to stop and go consult this other resource that tells you what 
              you're allowed to do. People hate that. And it's very easy to ignore that stuff if no one's checking.</li>
              <li>They also inevitably feel outdated a month after you've created them</li>
              <li>Your stylesheets are so much better because they're always current, always relevant</li>
              <li>They lend themselves to being continuously improved as your work, as opposed to a style guide which can feel set 
              in stone</li>
              <li>You have to go out of your way if you want to deviate from them. And if you do deviate, you'd better be able to explain
              why you did because everyone's going to see it when you do a code review, which we'll talk about in a minute.</li>
              <li>So those are the benefits, and to my mind they make this process very worthwhile, but switching over to it is not 
              without pain.</li>
